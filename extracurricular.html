      <p> This year I've assumed a couple of leadership roles outside of school. I did a couple of volleyball clinics, the purpose of which often revolved around girls my age assuming a role-model position for starting young volleyball players. I did this for a couple of weeks, but eventually stopped to better focus on school activities. </p>
