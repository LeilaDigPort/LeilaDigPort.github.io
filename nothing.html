    <h2 class="nothing"> Mid-year Reflection Questions and Responses </h2>
      
      <ol> 
          <li> <h4> How broad is your friend group? Are peers easily accepted (within your group or outside of your group)? What have you done/can you do to improve the social atmosphere within your group of friends, grade-level, or school?  </h4></li> 
          <p> </p>
          <p> I think that I have an extensive friend group.This year I and my friend group have experimented with sitting and talking with those we normally don't -- including those from other grades. I think we've improved the inclusiveness of the social atmosphere especially by sitting with sixth grade and getting to know their individual personalities. This is an important job, considering it is the responsibility of eighth graders to socialize with and incorporate younger grades into the community.  </p>
      <li> <h4> How have you contributed to our community this year? Provide examples of any leadership roles you have assumed or how you have been a role model (these examples can be academic, social, or from extracurricular activites). How have you grown as a leader/role model, or what are some ideas on how to assume these roles in the future?</h4> </li>
    <p> </p>
    <p> This year I've assumed a couple of leadership roles outside of school. I did a couple of volleyball clinics, the purpose of which often revolved around girls my age assuming a role-model position for starting young volleyball players. I did this for a couple of weeks, but eventually stopped to better focus on school activities. </p>
    <li> <h4>  Are you consistent with completing work on time? What is hindering/helping you?  </h4> </li>
        <p> In the fall portion of the year, I feel that I was consistent and responsible enough with finishing and submitting homework, but my skills have deteriorated around the middle of the year, due to a couple of contributing factors. </p>
