        <h3> Strength </h3>
       <p>      Fall 2019 I believed that one of my academic strengths involved the ability to analyze and make literary and historical connections. While I was specific about what conditions I needed to act on this strength (ample time and the opportunity for thought collection) I feel that I am more able to think and draw conclusions while I am under a  a shorter time limit. </p> 
        <h3> Stretch </h3>
         <p> During the fall portion of the year, I felt that one of my biggest weaknesses as a student was a lack of ability to participate in class discussions. My opinion was that I gave my best work while doing assignments at home (when I had more time and the opportunity to think a little deeper) and that my skill as a student was lessened in the classroom environment, where participation and the ability to analyze quickly and effectively was necessary. However, my development throughout the year has changed my opinion on this, and considering my performance in the last couple of months, I feel I have an easier time learning in the classroom quickly as opposed to working at home. </p>
