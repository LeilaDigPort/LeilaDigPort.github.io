      <h2> Literature Artifact </h2>
      <p> Among the assignments I've completed this year in Literature, I am most proud of my work in the Scarlet Letter essay. The book itself was very interesting to me, so it was easy to find sufficient analysis and connections and pass them into my writing. I finished the essay with timeliness, which positively reflected my stretch and demonstrated my development this year. </p>

      <h2> Social Studies Artifact </h2>
      <p> Among the varied work I've completed this year in Social Studies, I am most proud of what I've written in the Seesaw posts. I feel that my work on Seesaw demonstrates my SMART goal -- of developing better time management -- very well, seeing as each post I completed in a timely manner and still felt good about the quality of the writing. </p>
      
      
      <h2> Spanish Artifact </h2>
      <p> I feel most proud of my "Mis veranos cuando peque√±a" script, where I feel I demonstrated good knowledge of the Spanish skills we have learned so far and put together sentences with better fluency than I previously had. I also completed this assignment with timeliness, reflecting my SMART goal positively. </p>
      
      <h2> Math Artifact </h2>
      <p> I feel most proud of my notetaking journal in math, where I have diligently taken notes on nearly every lesson (some are missing due to absences, but I have still learned the material).</p>
