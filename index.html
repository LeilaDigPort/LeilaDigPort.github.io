      <h4> <p> SMART GOAL: </p></h4>
      <P> I hope to work towards the goal of developing time management skills. </P>
      <p> Throughout my academic career, the concept of time management has always been problematic. I never developed the necessary skills to quickly and efficiently finish schoolwork at a respectable time; instead, I've always been a slow worker and prone to the unfortunate habit of procrastination. This year, I hope to rectify this pattern by more meticulously tracking time while doing homework and finishing in-class assignments and essays at a more reasonable time. My SMART goal is extremely relevant to my future; since in the next academic stages of my life -- such as high school and college -- deadlines and time limits are an unfortunate necessity.   </p>
      
       <p> My development for the first portion of the year regarding this SMART goal has been considerable. My study habits have changed both negatively and positively, and I've spent ample time thinking of this subject and the impact it will have on my future. In the Humanities portion of eighth grade, I feel that my study and homework habits have deteriorated and I am less able to consistently finish work on time than I have been previously. On the other hand, perhaps to balance this, I believe that I have developed the skill to think and draw conclusions while under a shorter time limit, such as in-class.  </p>
